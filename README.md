# Jan Sweelinck â€“ Organ Pieces (v2.1)

Though Sweelinck's contemporary cultural environment and training arguably belong to the Renaissance, his status as an influential organ teacher made him extremely significant in the establishment of the Baroque. The precision of imitative counterpoint and the handling of chromatic motion demonstrated in this Fantasia foreshadow, both in impact and in technical function, the fugues that J.S. Bach would write over a century later. Though its composition date is not specifically known, this may be the oldest work in the Distant Listening Corpus, and its harmonic successions are somewhat indeterminate in their syntax, characteristic of the Renaissance; however, the chromatic working that appears throughout creates strong leading-tone functions which hint at the dominant-centric approach to harmonic function that would emerge in the century after Sweelinck's death.
